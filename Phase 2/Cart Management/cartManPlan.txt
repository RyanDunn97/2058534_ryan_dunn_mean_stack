Planning:
- seems very similar to budget project
- must use local/session storage
- typescript and html are all that's required
- add css/bootstrap for fun if I want
- typescript: think it's arrays and objects primarily
	- can form a class for this!! :o

Steps:
1. Setup initial file structure X
2. Setup layout of html X
	the container holding the four boxes
	the names and prices of each box
	the functionless 'add' buttons
3. figure out what typescript is needed
	add functionality to change size of cart X
	add functionality to store obj when added X
		add values to add buttons in html X
		check that it's working with console logs X
	add functionality to create the table from storage X
	load the count to cart size when opening that page?
4. implement typescript X
5. (optional) add images to each card
6. (optional) add pretty bootstrap

Questions/Notes:
- what typescript specialties am i using?
- wow. really just hardcode 4 items into the cart page
- function should be 'dynamic' with two inputs,
	but each implementation can have hardcoded values
