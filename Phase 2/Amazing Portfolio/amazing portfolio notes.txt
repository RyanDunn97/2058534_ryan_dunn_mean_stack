Amazing Profile Assignment Notes:

Section 6, lesson 1.20
Due Date: Tuesday, 17th

Plan:
- create angular project 'amazing-portfolio'
- create three components 'login', 'portfolio', 'registration'
	!!! actually pretty sure these are fake components
	ie. they are 3 parts that exist in one component
- for registering, save info from registration form in storage
	then require that for loggin in
- upon successful login, go to portfolio page
- !!! use *ngIf to hide components that aren't being used
	we are not navigating to other pages
- storage: actually don't need storage
- angular is one page application, so we can store one (or more) users
	on a variable
- use 3 divs with *ngIf's for the 'components'
- create functions 'showPage' for each page which alters the variables
	for the ngIf statements
- use array to store contact details and ngFor to display
- may require a <form>; might make easier, will see
	will make extracting values from text fields easier
	don't need to store the 
- on ts, create values for user and array for contacts
- pressing 'login' will check the values of fields
	if correct->call switch page
- create an interface file and import it for the contacts
- registering sets username
- 'save' button will push contact data to contact array

Steps:
1. create angular project X
2. create function to switch pages X
3. add buttons for switching pages X
	login: port and reg, reg: login, port: login
4. Add relevant text fields to each 'page' X
	login: user, pass ; port: span user, contact name, phone ;
	registration: first name, last, user, password
5. create interface file and make an array of that X
6. create the table of that X
	LFG!!! :)))
7. create login function
	test by replacing button and setting up form
8. create/test registration function


Questions notes:
- now just require taking input for user, contacts, and
	validating user
