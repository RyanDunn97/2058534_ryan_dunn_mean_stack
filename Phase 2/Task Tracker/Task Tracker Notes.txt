Plan:
- Make the form
- Make the form function
- Add the angular components

Steps:
1. Create interface
    import and test
2. create user input
3. create table
    test with dummy interface obj
4. create saveTask function to update table
5. add pwa feel
6. run ng build (see if it works offline)
7. zip files w/o nodes module and submit


Notes:
- submit in section 8, task tracker
- very similar to portfolio apparently
- must display workers daily tasks in a component using PWA
- very similar to the portfolio page of proj, but using PWA
- PWA => google 'angular material' and use the components
    specified on this webpage
- may require offline capability 'pwa' for this
