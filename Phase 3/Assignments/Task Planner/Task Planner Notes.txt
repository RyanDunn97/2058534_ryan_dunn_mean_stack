Phase 3
Task Planner

Submit: phase 3, section 1
Due: 30th

Plan:
- make task ID unique
- at bottom of page, display everything in a table
- storing the info in a separate json file
- load json as array for adding, deleting
	then overwrite file with updated array
- can make format very similar to today's proj

Steps:
1. Follow today's lesson to display the page's format X
2. Create functionality for showing table X !!! LFG :)))
3. Create functionality for adding a task X !!! LFG!!!
	load json/setup file system X
	check that the task ID is unique in the array X
	push json obj to array X
	append to array X
4. Create functionality deleting a task X
	delete item from array X
	overwrite the array; make sure this overwrites completely X


Notes/Q's:
- how to 'dynamically' form the table:
	use a for loop? lol not sure currently
	the 'show table' button sends you to /display and then 
		appends the table. this makes sense
- include a main page write with every button press
