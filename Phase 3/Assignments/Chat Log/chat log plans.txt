For phase end chatlog,
- start off using the chatting with socket io as beginning point
- replace part where you send a random server message with storing the client
	message into mongodb
- install express, mongoose, socket.io
- in the emit on server side, this is where you put the mongoose.insert

need:
-	mongo in {name:String, message:String}
- literally just storing the messages in mongo

plan:
1. look over power point X
2. copy layout of chat bot program X
3. switch out random messages for saves to the database
