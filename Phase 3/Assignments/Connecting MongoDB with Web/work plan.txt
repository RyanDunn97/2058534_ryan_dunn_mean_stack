Today's Proj:

Using mongoose
Don't need POST, PUT, etc because I can just use express and use functions
	to store in DB
Actually think I might still try out MVC, but just don't have to use POST(et all)
	can just take input from fields and make functions to interact with DB
What was i thinking, express has functions for this operations


Questions:
- separate pages have separate forms
	how do those forms do POST, PUT, etc?
- How do I get the info 
	checkUser in login.html is a good example
- function is a route
	get sent there through a form's action
	just like in their example

guess i need to double check the backend code with mine, find URL error?

if i'm not seeing the issue, might just legit copy his code lol

I think I'm just going to do assignment with express and then do section end 
	material tomorrow during class time

for uniqueness: let found = userDetails.find(u=>u.uname==user && u.pname==pass);
    if(found != undefined){
	where userDetails is the database that's loaded in each function

i think connection goes at the beginning,
	not sure where the once's go
	ohhhhh you don't need the once's.... jesus
Plan:
1. make necessary installs X
2. setup necessary pages X
	- follow express js page example X
	- create relevant html pages X
		Home X	Add	X	Update X	Delete	X	Fetch X
3. Create layout for html pages X
4. Setup mongoose to connect DB!
5. Create functions that work with mongoose
